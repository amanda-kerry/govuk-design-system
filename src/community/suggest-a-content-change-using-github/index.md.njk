The GOV.UK Design System team uses a service called GitHub to manage content in the GOV.UK Design System.

This guide explains how to suggest a change to the Design System content using GitHub. 

If you get stuck whilst following the steps and you need help, you can:

- email the GOV.UK Design System team on govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk
- get in touch on Slack

## 1. Sign to GitHub

[Sign into GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system). 

If you do not have one already, you can [create a GitHub account for free](https://github.com/).

## 2. Open the GOV.UK Design System project

Go to the GOV.UK Design System project, which lives at [github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system).

## 3. Find the markdown file for the page you want to edit

The folder names in the Design System project on GitHub map to the page URLs in the Design System website.

In a new tab, open the Design System and go to the page you want to edit.

Find the markdown file for this page by looking in the “src” (source) folder in GitHub and finding the section and page you want to edit.

For example, if you wanted to edit the Checkboxes page, you would note down the URL for the page, https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/checkboxes.

Then look for the matching folder in the src folder, which in this example is `src/components/checkboxes/`

The main content for each Design System page is found in the `index.md.njk` file.

The examples included in each page are found in additional subfolders. For example, the first example for the Checkboxes page is found in `src/components/checkboxes/default`.

Once you’ve found the file you want to change, you can edit it with the change you want to suggest.

## 4. Edit the page file

Start editing a page file by selecting the pencil icon at the right-hand side of the screen.

Edit the markdown to make your change.

Here is an example showing how to update the description of the checkboxes component.

In this example, we’ve changed the uppercase ‘C’ on the word ‘Checkbox’ to lowercase.

## 5. Propose a change

Once you’re happy, scroll to the bottom of the page until you reach the button that says ‘propose file change’.

Add a short description of what you have changed in the first field. This information will be added to the file’s changelog. Try to be as clear as possible, so that future users can understand what you have done. 

If you need to provide information about why you made the change, you can add more detail in the larger field below.

When you are happy with your description, select ‘propose file change’. You will have a chance to review and confirm your changes on the next page.

## 6. Confirm your changes

You will be shown a confirmation page where you can review the changes you’ve made. 

If you spot a mistake, you can go back to the previous page and correct it. 

If you are happy with your changes, select ‘Create pull request’. You will have one more chance to review your change on the next page before you submit it to the GOV.UK Design System team to review.

## 7. Create a pull request

A pull request is a request sent to the team who maintains the project you’re making changes to—in this case, the GOV.UK Design System team. 

It tells them what you’ve changed and gives them the option to ‘pull’ or add your changes into the project, where it can then be published. 

At this point, you can write additional comments about the work you’ve done if you want to.

These will be shared with the GOV.UK Design System team when you submit your proposed change. 

It will be pre-filled with the information you entered when you proposed the file change in step 5. Please be aware that updating the information here will not change the original description you provided, but will send it in addition.

Once you’re happy with your change, select ‘Create pull request’.

## 8. Wait for a review from the team

The GOV.UK Design System team will be notified of your suggestion and will review it at their next triage session, which happens every Wednesday.

The team will either:

- accept your proposal and publish your change straight away
- accept your proposal but ask for some changes before publishing
- not accept your proposal and explain why
